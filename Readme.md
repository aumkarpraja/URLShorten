# URLShorten

This is a simple URL shortener written using Python and Django. It makes use of the built in models system. I will be putting up a Heroku link to a live demo soon. In the mean time...

## Set up instructions
1. Unpack folder, cd into the directory and start up the virtual environment that has everything set up for you! 

`source env/Scripts/activate`
2. If you see an env tag above, you're good to go! Next, start up the server, use the command:

`python manage.py runserver`
3. You should see it go up, as soon as that happens you should see the server up and you can navigate to localhost:8000 to check out the URL shortener.
